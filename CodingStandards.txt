This document outlines the standards for all code written in this project.
There will be a section for general standards in all coding languages, as well as some for individual languages.

Ganeral coding:

Opening braces should be on the same line as the code related to it, not a seperate line.
Any if statement without braces must entirely be on one line for clarity,
 if there is an else on seperate line, use braces.
Initialize all variables when they're declared, or explicitly set to NULL.
Output string literals should be in single quotes,
 most other uses of string literals should be double quoted.
Always end lines with semicolon (when appropriate).
Function names should use lower camel case: functionName
Class names should use upper camel case: ClassName
Use spaces only when necessary or makes code more readable,
 no need to seperate parentheses from surrounding, but spaces between operators: if(x + y == 3){ NOT if ( x+y==3 ) {
 may use spaces to help group/seperate many parentheses: if( ((condition1) && (condition2)) || function(condition3) ){

File Extensions and Content:

HTML/PHP code should be seperated into either pure PHP or primarily HTML files.
Purely PHP files should:
 have .php extension
 start with opening <?PHP but have no closing ?>
 contain no HTML code except possibly debugging echo statements if necessary
Primarily HTML files should:
 have .phtml extension
 always be formatted as a proper HTML file (see HTML below)
 contain no more than a few lines of PHP code in a given PHP tag
 mainly just use PHP to retrieve values to be displayed
Additionally, HTML should contain almost no formatting information, use .css files for formatting
If there is more than several lines of JS code in a script tag, it should be put in an external .js file

PHP:

Name variables using the PHP standard of _ for spaces: variable_name
Use no parentheses for echo: echo 'Hello World!';
Use type hinting and return type declaration for all function parameters.

JavaScript:

Name variables using lower camel case: variableName
Declare and initialize all variables at beginning of scope(function or script).

jQuery:

Use $document as opposed to shorthand $ in most cases.

HTML:

All tagnames should be capitalized, no need for spaces between name and brackets,
 but spaces should surround the tag for readability: <BODY> NOT < body >
All attribute names should be capitalized, values should be double quoted,
 except if it's a numeric value: <TAGNAME attribute1="value" attribute2=0>
Avoid putting multiple opening tags on a line without closing tags.
